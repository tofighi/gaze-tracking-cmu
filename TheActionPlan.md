# Introduction #

One slide presentation due next week. Writeup and Poster Session due the following week.

# The Plan #

  1. Visualize calculated gaze direction (big arrow!)
  1. Correct segmentation bug between 2D box and 3D point cloud
  1. Create 3D model of room
  1. Create program to assign gaze to best object-of-gaze estimate
  1. Match outputs of above program to human-labeled data
  1. Interpolate higher order features around labeled robot deictic gesture events
  1. Add new data to overall analysis set as automating the video-coding is much faster than human-labeling the data
